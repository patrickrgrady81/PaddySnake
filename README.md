# PaddySnake (back end)
This is a snake game based on the old nokia snake I used to play on my flip phone. I made slight changes to the ideas in that game. I like the fact that I can go through walls Pacman style. Also, with the backend players can register and login to get their scores saved in the top 10 if they are good enough.

## Usage
To use this app, just clone, run bundle, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed and then rails s.
Then run the front end of the snake app.
